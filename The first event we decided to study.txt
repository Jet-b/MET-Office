- June 2019
- Prolonged length, causing 500 deaths
- Broke temperature records all over europe
- how humans have effected the likelihood of extreme temperature

- We were provided with 2 sets of data 525
- All forcings and natural forcings, explain
- Oberved

- Histogram
- Turned into normal distribution
- orange All Forcings
- brown Natural Forcings
- All forcings has a generally positive temperature anomaly 
- Natural forcings has a generally negative temperature anomaly
- calculate the area under the graph 3.71 - infinity
- We can work out the risk ratio

- Final risk ratio of 80.4
- 80.4 

- Began bootstrapping 
- Take a random sample with replacement equal size
- Did this up to 10 000 times 
- Plot histogram of the newly calculated risk ratios
- Get a potential spread of our data
- top and bottom 5% confidence of 90%
- interval of 29.4 to 249.4

- How did we pick the number of bootstraps
- same data bootsrapped a different number of times 
- histograms clearly smooth out
- We agreed that 5 000 was the best
- Only had time for 2 000
